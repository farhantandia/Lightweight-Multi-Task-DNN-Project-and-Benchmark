# Lightweight-Multi-Task-DNN-Project-and-Benchmark
 This Repository contains my designed lightweight deep neural network model for action recognition and re-identification on smart surveillance system application, and benchmark using UTKFace dataset. This work is part of my master degree thesis at NYCU, Taiwan.

# Multi-task Deep Neural Network
The conventional supervised learning of deep neural network is not well applicable with the increasing needs of todayâ€™s complex decision making especially in smart surveillance systems because the real-world problem often involves multiple complexes of factors and criteria. Thus, multi-task learning (MTL) with multi-output capabilities has emerged as a solution. The MTL is a subfield of AI in which multiple tasks are simultaneously learned by a shared model. This method as being inspired by human learning makes the model beings more accurate than single-task learning.
